## Staying Updated with Git

### Prerequisites

* **Git installed**
  * Windows: install Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * macOS: `brew install git` (if Homebrew) or download installer
  * Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent
* **VS Code installed**
  * Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hex-grid.git
   ```

2. Change into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd hex-grid
   ```

### Open in VS Code

In the terminal (inside the project directory), run:

```bash
code .
```

VS Code will launch, showing the project.

### Configure VS Code's Git Integration

1. VS Code already has Git built-in. In the Activity Bar (left), click the **Source Control** icon.
2. You'll see "0 changes" (clean working tree).

### Enable Auto-fetch (Optional)

1. Open Settings (File â†’ Preferences â†’ Settings).
2. Search for **Git: Auto Fetch** and check the box.
3. Optionally set **Git: Auto Refresh** to true so the UI updates.

   Now VS Code will periodically fetch remote commits in the background.

### Pulling in the Latest Changes

Whenever there are new changes in the repository:

* A ðŸ”„ badge will appear on the Source Control icon.
* Click **â‹¯ â†’ Pull** in the Source Control menu, or run in the built-in terminal:

  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

* This will merge the latest updates into your local copy.

### Tips for Git Beginners

* **Commit often.** Save snapshots of your own tweaks.
* **Use branches** if you want to experiment without touching `main`.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b my-ideas
  ```
* **GitHub Desktop** is an alternative GUI if the CLI feels too scary.
